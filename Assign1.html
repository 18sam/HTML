<h1 style="background-color:LightGray;">Antarctica</h1>

<p><b> The continent of Antarctica makes up most of the Antarctic region.</b> The Antarctic is a cold, remote area in the Southern Hemisphere encompassed by the Antarctic Convergence.</p>

<p>Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent in terms of total area. The Antarctic Ice Sheet dominates the region. It is the largest single piece of ice on Earth.</p>
 
<p>This ice sheet even extends beyond the continent when snow and ice are at their most extreme.</p>

<p>Davis Station is Australiaâ€™s busiest scientific research station. It is located in an ice-free area known as the Vestfold Hills. Food supplies are, however, very limited. </p>
<p>The food supply for a year at Davis Station is rationed, per person per year. Residents live mostly on frozen and canned food.</p>

<p>The most familiar animal of Antarctica is probably the penguin. Their feathers retain a layer of air, helping them keep warm in the freezing water.</p>
